# BMI323_Driver
This is a C++ driver for the BMI323 tri-axis accelerometer/gyroscope. It was developed on a NUCLEO-H723ZG development board with MbedCE!

The goal is to have compability with both SPI and I2C. For my purposes, it sufficies to have compatability for it's gyro, accel, and temp sensor.
